                In order to increase my knowledge of functional interfaces and the logic that goes into them, I decided to code a simple shopping interface to be as intuitive and easy-to-use as possible. Here, I decided to go with a bakery where the users could choose from items to order and the interface let them do so with ease while calculating the final price and also keeping track of their preferences filter out items. This task introduced me to the coding side of things and helped me undestand how to look at interfaces more technically and understand the ramifications that go beyond simplt making design changes.

                The interface has the following working. There is a grid for items for users to choose from coded with an external library called Next UI. The grids have cards in them with pictures, preferences and the prices with an add-to-cart button. The users can click these to add items to the cart which has a remove functionality and computes the final price. Lastly, users can also sort items in the grid by price and filter them with criteria like gluten free and vegan.
